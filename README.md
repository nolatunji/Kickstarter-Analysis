# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This analysis of Kickstarter campaings is aimed at uncovering and communicating the trends we found that lead to successful Kickstarter campaigns. This analysis focuses specifically on Kickstarter campaigns in the theater category.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Kickstarter Analysis project provides insight into the outcomes of Kickstarter crowdfunding campaigns that were aimed at raising funds for theater projects. Our client Louise is a playwright who is planning to launch a new crowdfunding campaign and has asked for an analysis of campaign outcomes based on the launch date of the campaign and the goal amount. 

### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to maximize Louise's probablity of success with launching her current theater crowdfunding camapign. This will be accomplished by analyzing during which months the most successful campaigns are launched. Additionally the analysis will include insight into the funding goal amounts that have been the most successful in the past. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The first part of the analysis looked at the outcomes of past theater campaigns based on the launch date of the campaign. Campaigns that were analyzed fell into one of three outcome categories: successful, failed, or cancelled. Using a pivot table the data from the main Kickstarter worksheet was analyzed using the 'outcomes' and 'launch date' fields in a new worksheet. This data was filtered for parent category to only include campaigns that were aimed at theater projects. The PivotTable used can be viewed here:

Using the information from the PivotTable a line chart was used to visualize the Theater campaigns by outcome data. The graph can be viewed here:

The next part of the analysis looked at the outcomes of theater campaigns based on the funding goal of the campaigns. Using the COUNTIF function in Excel the number of successful, failed, or cancelled projects were counted based on their goal amounts. The campaigns were counted and organized into twelve goal amount ranges starting from $0 to greater than $50,000. A line chart was also created for this data to assist with the visualization and analysis of the information. The Campaign Outcomes vs Goal amount line chart can be viewed here:
